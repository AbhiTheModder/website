      <description>TL;DR Jump to the Ideas list.
Introduction Each year since 2015, we have participated in Google Summer of Code as the Radare2 project and accomplished many goals. This year we participate as a fork - Rizin, but effectively continuing the same process and the same mentors.
Mentors Members of the Rizin and Cutter core teams have volunteered to guide students for GSoC’21. They were already guiding the students for the GSoC and RSoC in past years as part of the Radare2 project.</description>
